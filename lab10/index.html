        <h1>Jareline Quiroz's Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        
        <main>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Jareline Quiroz. I am a second year industrial and interaction design major who is interested in UX design
            and web development. In my free time, I enjoy watching TV sitcoms. Some of my favorites are Modern Family and Abbott Elementary.
            I also enjoy woodworking, playing badminton, and finding new music to listen to. I love listening to The Marias, SZA, and
            beabadoobee, so <strong>definitely</strong> check them out!</p>
        <p> I was born and raised in New York City. I have an older brother and sister, both of whom majored in computer science. I don't have
            much coding experience, aside from the AP CSP class I took back in high school, but I am <strong>excited</strong> to learn more about
            web development from a coding perspective. When I am not studying or designing, I love finding new places to eat around campus. So far,
            my favorite place has been Pastabilities, but I am always on the lookout for new food recommendations. This semester, I am looking
            forward to building my design portfolio using the skills I learn in this class!</p>
        <strong>My Skills:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign</li>
            <li>3D modeling and perspective sketching</li>
            <li>Trained in wood and metal shop techniques</li>
            <li>Fluent in Spanish, proficient in Italian</li>
        </ul>
