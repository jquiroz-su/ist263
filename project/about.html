                <h1> hi, i'm jareline.</h1>
                <p>Thanks for checking out my website! I'm a second year industrial and interaction design student
                        at Syracuse University interested in UX design and web development.
                </p>
                <h2>How I got started</h2>
                <p> My love for design began long before my journey at Syracuse University - tinkering with objects
                    around the house and exploring creativity through apps like Roblox, as a kid. What started as curiosity
                    has grown into a passion for problem-solving and creating experiences that leave a positive impact for 
                    those around me.
                </p>
                <h2>A liitle about me</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in New York City. The hustle and bustle of the city has always been something I've
                    gravitated towards, but I'm just as passionate about making design more enjoyable. When I'm not deisgning,
                    I love finetuning my woodworking skills and more recently, learning ceramics. I love going on roadtrips and
                    visiting national parks whenever I have the chance, although that isn't as often as I'd like. If you like my
                    work, or you're just a fellow design geek like me, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
