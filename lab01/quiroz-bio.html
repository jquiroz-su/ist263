    <body>
    My name is Jareline Quiroz. I am an industrial and interaction major interested in UX design and web development. I am proficient in Adobe software, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. In my free time I enjoy watching TV sitcoms. Some of my favorites are Modern Family and Abbott Elementary. I also enjoy woodworking and finding new music to listen to.
